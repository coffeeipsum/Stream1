                        <p>The short answer is that writing code tells the computer what to do.<br>
                            Here's a longer answer: Computer code is a set of rules or instructions.<br>
                            It is made up of words and numbers and when you put them in the right order it will tell your computer what you want it to do.<br>
                            This page is written with code.<br>
                            Have you heard about Facebook?<br>
                            Facebook and all it's functionality (writing a post, comment, liking a post, etc.) is written in (computer code).

                        <h3>Why learning Code?</h3>
                        <p>"Imagine a brand new language is replacing English as *the* leading international means of communication — its vocabulary is growing exponentially, soon only those who speak it fluently will be able to fully participate in the world, do business, lead, shape, innovate... Now imagine the vast majority of girls and women are not learning this language.
                            That is the kind of crisis we are facing right now in technology.<br>
                            Computer coding is the new literacy in our thriving digital world but the number of girls and women learning the language has hit an all time low.
                            The tech sector has transformed our lives more than any other in the last 25 years with seismic and irreversible shifts in the way we communicate, do business and organise our lives, and it promises to define the way we live well into the future."

                        <h3>And why else?</h3>
                        <p>There will be more than 800.000+ vacant jobs by 2020.<br>
                            Currently there are only around 12 % of women working in IT related jobs.<br>
                            Did you know? There is a project for equality which is called "50 / 50 by 2020" which creates a need for companies to employ an equal number of women in Tech / IT related jobs.<br>
                            This will be a great chance to get a well paid job in tech as a woman.<br>
                            Usually a tech job is well paid, including flexible working hours. There are even jobs to work from home or to work remotely.

                        <h2>Where is code used?</h2>
                        <p>The answer is simple: EVERYWHERE<br>
                            Everything around us. The entire internet. Fitbit, social media like FB, Insta, etc. But also, (nearly) everything that has a ppower plug.
                            Have you ever heard about "IoT" that means the "Internet of Things" soon we'll have an app which controlls our washing machine, frigdge, house alarm, heating, etc.
                            In the near future there will be an app for everything.
