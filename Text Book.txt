What is code?

(microsoftlearning *** What is coding?  )

[take infos from this video **VIDEO on https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/  ]

<p>
The short answer is that writing code tells the computer what to do, but it’s not quite that simple.

Here's a longer answer: Computer code is a set of rules or instructions. It is made up of words and numbers and when you put them in the right order it will tell your computer what you want it to do.

This page is written with code.

<H2>
Why learning code?

<p>
"Imagine a brand new language is replacing English as *the* leading international means of communication — its vocabulary is growing exponentially, soon only those who speak it fluently will be able to fully participate in the world, do business, lead, shape, innovate...

Now imagine the vast majority of girls and women are not learning this language.

That is the kind of crisis we are facing right now in technology.
Computer coding is the new literacy in our thriving digital world but the number of girls and women learning the language has hit an all time low.

The tech sector has transformed our lives more than any other in the last 25 years with seismic and irreversible shifts in the way we communicate, do business and organise our lives, and it promises to define the way we live well into the future."

========= FOR  L A T E R  =======================

Why Do We Have So Many Languages?
Because different languages are designed to be used for different purposes – some are useful for web development, others useful for writing desktop software, others useful for solving scientific and numeric problems, and so on.
